# Bootloader_for_Autonomous_Cars_with_Obstacle_Avoidance_APP
## Bootloader Development for Autonomous Cars based on STM32F401 and Agile methodology.
### The project aims to develop and implement a bootloader system for autonomous cars, The bootloader will allow for firmware updates to be installed without requiring an on-chip programmer.
## Application:
### Implemented an obstacle-avoiding car using ultrasonic sensor, DC motors and servo motor based on STM32 microcontroller.
